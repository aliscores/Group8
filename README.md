Our main goal is to really dive into YouTube data to make our channel better and attract more viewers. Since the online world is getting more crowded, using data to make smart decisions is key, especially on a big platform like YouTube.
To get started, we're looking at three important sets of data. At the top of the list is the "YouTube Channel and Influencer Analysis" (Data 1). This set will show us what makes a YouTube channel popular and what types of videos people like to watch. By understanding this, we can create videos that our viewers will love and want to watch again and again.
Using this information, we can plan our videos more wisely. We'll know what our viewers like and can create more of that type of content. This way, our current viewers will stick around, and we'll also bring in new ones. By combining our creativity with what the data tells us, we can make sure our videos reach as many people as possible.
